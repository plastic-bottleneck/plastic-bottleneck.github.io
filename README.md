> Hi and welcome to the source of my website!  
> Have a look around if you like and have fun :)  

My original website was hosted on (http) [plastic-bottleneck.42web.io](http://plastic-bottleneck.42web.io) which was provided by a really sketchy free webhosting service for yk... for free... if you don't count your cookies or personal information as valuable.  
So now I moved to GitHub Pages to host my website with https enabled and no more sketchy (at least less due to Microsoft owning GitHub) data collecting!
