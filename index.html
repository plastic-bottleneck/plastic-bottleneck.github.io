    <h2>About me</h2>
    <pre>
I am interested in various scientific fields, including astronomy, 
meteorology, radio operations, and computer science.

Collecting computers has been a hobby of mine for as long as I can 
remember. To date, I’ve collected around 49 of them!

The oldest one in my collection is the Sperry Univac (1955).

When I was young, I got my first Commodore C64 from a friend. Programming 
on it was a lot of fun! 
Sadly, a bad power supply bricked it.
The MOS6502 fascinated me because it can run basically anything! 
That’s how I got into programming a bit of 6502 assembly back then. 
Now, I primarily program in C — which I LOVE! I've also done some HDA
and other chipprograming!

My main operating systems in daily use: OpenBSD and 9front
The 9front grid consists of 1 file server, 1 authentication server and
16 CPU servers

I primarily use OpenBSD and 9front over Linux because of the stability 
and the super clean codebase they provide.

Radios fascinate me too! I have built multiple antennas for different 
purposes, such as receiving NOAA weather satellite images or QSOs from 
around the world at night.

One day, I want to complete my ham radio exam and go live like the other 
cool operators!

Another hobby I love is playing the piano and church organ. 
I’ve been doing this for nearly 14 years now.
I also collect instruments.
In total I've got one grand piano, one upright piano, 3 harpsicords
and 5 organs!

You can reach out to me over IRC at irc.libera.chat!
My nick is plbn and am mostly active in #plan9, #openbsd, #hamradio,
##chat and #linux

Maybe my GitHub can be interesting for you too!

Have a great day!
