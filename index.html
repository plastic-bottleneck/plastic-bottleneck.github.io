    <h2>About me</h2>
    <pre>
Hi,
my name is Paul, the maintainer of this webpage.
I'm a student from Germany who enjoys working with computers and general
technology, especially from the era before the 2000s.

I'm currently studying church music and I love playing the piano and pipe organ.
I'm also interested in various scientific fields such as human anatomy
(general biology), astronomy, meteorology, geology, radio physics, chemistry,
and computer science!

I also take great pleasure in collecting computers and have gathered 38 of them
over the years. My oldest one is the Sperry Univac from 1955.
I'm fascinated by the 6502 processor and, as a result, own two C64's.
I have a deep appreciation for Commodore as a company, which unfortunately went
bankrupt back then. However, my server has been running IBM systems
for years without any errors.

My collection of computers has allowed me to delve into various CPU architectures.
As a result, I enjoy writing in 6502 and x86_64 assembler
and C, which I particularly adore.

Why Unix?
Opting for Unix-based systems like OpenBSD and 9front as my daily drivers
isn't just about practicality â€” it's about choosing reliability and finely crafted software.
While some might find using 9front for everyday tasks unconventional, I see it as
leveraging its exceptional capabilities, especially in scientific research.
9front goes beyond typical desktop operating systems; it excels in specialized usage.
Meanwhile, when I need a platform capable of handling web browsing,
including JavaScript and CSS, albeit at a slower pace, OpenBSD fits the bill.
It's all about appreciating the elegance of well-engineered software solutions,
where each line of code is a testament to skillful craftsmanship.

"UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity."
- Brian Kernighan
